## <a name="Introduction">1. Introduction</a>

This documentation describes the Bing Voice Output API which exposes an HTTP interface that enables developers to synthesize voice queries. The Bing Voice Output API may be used in many different contexts that need cloud-based voice recognition and synthesis capabilities.  

## <a name="VoiceSynReq">2. Voice Synthesis Request</a>

Clients must use the following end-point to access the service and build voice enabled applications: [https://speech.platform.bing.com/synthesize](https://speech.platform.bing.com/synthesize) 

Note! Until you have submitted your subscription key as described in [Bing Voice Recognition](./BingVoiceRecognition.md), this link will generate a 403 Response Error.

The API uses HTTP POST to send audio back to the client. The maximum amount of audio returned for a given request must not exceed 15 seconds. 
 
### <a name="Http">HTTP headers</a>

Here are the HTTP headers for the request:


Header   |Value  |Comments 
---------|---------|---------
Content-Type     |    application/ssml+xml     |      The input content type   
X-Microsoft-OutputFormat     |    **1)** raw-8khz-8bit-mono-mulaw, **2)** raw-16khz-16bit-mono-pcm, **3)** riff-8khz-8bit-mono-mulaw, **4)** riff-16khz-16bit-mono-pcm |       The output audio format  
X-Search-AppId     |    A GUID (hex only, no dashes)     |     An ID that uniquely identifies the client application. This can be Store ID for Apps. If one is not available, the ID may be user generated per-application.     
X-Search-ClientID     |     A GUID (hex only, no dashes)    |    An ID that uniquely identifies application instance per-installation.     
User-Agent     |     Application name    |     Application name is required and must be less than 255 characters.    
X-Search-PartnerEventID     |    A GUID (hex only, no dashes)     |     Azure Offer ID is a required parameter.    


### <a name="InputParam">Input parameters</a>

Inputs to the Bing Voice API are expressed as HTTP query parameters. Parameters in the POST body are treated as SSML content. Refer to the W3C specifications ([http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/](http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/)). The following is a complete list of recognized input parameters. Unsafe characters should be escaped following the W3C URL specifications ([http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/url-spec.txt](http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/url-spec.txt)). A request with more than one instance of any parameter will result in an error response (HTTP 400). 

###  <a name="SampleVoiceOR">Example voice output request</a>

The following is an example of a voice output request:  
 
```
POST /synthesize
HTTP/1.1
Host: speech.platform.bing.com
Content-Type: audio/wav; samplerate=8000

X-Microsoft-OutputFormat: riff-8khz-8bit-mono-mulaw
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

<speak version='1.0' xml:lang='en-US'><voice xml:lang='en-US' xml:gender='Female' name='Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ZiraRUS)'>Microsoft Bing Voice Output API</voice></speak>
```
 
## <a name="VoiceOutResponse">3. Voice Output Responses</a>

The API response contains the audio stream and the codec and will match the requested output format.
 
#### <a name="SuccessfulRecResponse">Succcessful recognition response</a>

Example JSON response for a successful voice search. The comments and formatting of the JSON below is for example reasons only. The real result will omit indentation spaces, smart quotes, comments, etc. 
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: XXX
Content-Type: audio/x-wav 

Response audio payload       
```
 
#### <a name="RecFailure">Recognition failure</a>

Example JSON response for a voice search query where the user’s speech could not be recognized.

```
HTTP/1.1 400 XML parser error
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-Length: 0
```
 
### <a name="ErrorResponse">Error responses</a>

**Http/400 Bad Request:** Will be returned if a required parameter is missing, empty or null, or if the value passed to either a required or optional parameter is invalid. The “Invalid” response includes passing a string value that is longer than the allowed length. A brief description of the problematic parameter will be included.  

**Http/401 Unauthorized:** Will be returned if the request is not authorized. 

**HTTP/413 RequestEntityTooLarge:**  Will be returned if the SSML input is larger than what is supported. 

**Http/502 BadGateway:** Network related problem or a server side issue. 

Example of Error response.
